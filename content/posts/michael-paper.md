Michael Davies, our research assistant, had his research on the influence on snow on air quality accepted [to the 
MDPI journal Air](https://www.mdpi.com/2813-4168/3/3/22). Michael is barely halfway through his undergraduate degree,
so this is a great accomplishment.

Keep your eyes peeled for a plain-language summary of his work and what it might mean for real-world applications.
