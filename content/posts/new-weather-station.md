#### TAG: TEAM

Our team is excited to announce the successful installation of a state-of-the-art weather monitoring station at our EXAMPLE field site! This new addition significantly enhances our atmospheric observation capabilities in the eastern Uinta Basin.


## Why Roosevelt?

The Roosevelt location fills a critical gap in our observation network. Positioned strategically between existing stations, it provides:
- Better spatial resolution for atmospheric modeling
- Enhanced monitoring of local microclimates
- Improved validation data for satellite observations

## Installation Challenges

Installing equipment in the Uinta Basin presents unique challenges:

### Extreme Temperatures
Winter temperatures can drop below -30Â°F, requiring special cold-weather rated equipment and careful cable management to prevent brittleness.

### Remote Location
The site's distance from main roads necessitated careful planning for:
- Equipment transportation
- Power solutions (solar + battery backup)
- Communication systems

### Wildlife Considerations
We implemented wildlife-resistant enclosures after learning from previous installations where curious cattle investigated our equipment!

## Station Specifications (can we put this in dropdown box?)

The new station features:
- Campbell Scientific CR1000X datalogger
- Vaisala WXT536 multi-parameter weather sensor
- Apogee SI-111 infrared radiometer
- Gill WindSonic anemometer
- Cellular modem for real-time data transmission


## Looking Ahead

This installation is part of our broader network expansion plan. Over the next year, we aim to:
- Add two additional stations
- Upgrade existing sensors
- Implement machine learning quality control

## Community Benefits


This station will contribute to several ongoing research projects:
1. Winter inversion studies
2. Boundary layer evolution analysis
3. Air quality monitoring support
4. Agricultural weather services

Local farmers and ranchers can access this data for:
- Frost warnings
- Irrigation planning
- Livestock management decisions
